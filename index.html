        1. Introduction
    </div>  
    <div class="main">
        The task presented was to use object recognition to count something over time. I think fish swimming look cool,
        and I was interested in seeing whether the overlapping swimming, where sometimes part of the second fish is obscured by the first,
        affects the labelling. 
    </div>  
    <div class="main">
        I also remembered that YOLO performs better with high quality images with large objects, so I thought
        the model would perform well on the set of images of these fish swimming: 2 objects taking up over 1 of the 7x7 sections most
        of the time, and several when fully pictured, and in reasonable quality of 720p.

        2. Method
    </div>  
    <div class="main">
        I used the <a href="https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7">YoloV7</a> model because I found a <a href="https://inside-machinelearning.com/en/use-yolov7/">tutorial</a> on it that was intuitive to me, and I could model my code on this.
        Currently, YoloV8 is the latest, state-of-the-art model, but YoloV7 is <a href="https://www.stereolabs.com/blog/performance-of-yolo-v5-v7-and-v8">comparable</a>.

        4. Analysis of Results
    </div>  
    <div class="main">
        I learned that fish aren't a priority for training data in the YOLO series, including the YoloV7 model. The model was very confident
        that the fish was a bird, and consistently. This is strange, and now I wonder: why mark it as a bird instead of not marking it at all?
        Focusing on the boxing, the overlap did cause problems for the dual-identification success, even at low levels of overlap.
        Finally, more than half of the fish being out-of-bounds resulted in no identification, most of the time.
        Overall, I had a lot of fun with this project and learned about some of the limitations of YOLO.

        5. Analysis of Vision Algorithms
    </div>  
    <div class="main">
        The model didn't identify the fish as fish, or consistently give the correct quantification.
        I didn't try to optimize the misidentification because this would involve training the model, and I don't have the knowledge
        or compute power to do this. I could 'throw out' images where only one box was provided, but this would result in very few images
        from the original video being included, and wouldn't be useful. I didn't choose another video because I wanted to be honest about my results,
        but if it is considered preferable to choose input data that fit the model in the future, please let me know and I will be happy to do this.
